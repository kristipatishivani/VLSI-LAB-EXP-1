                                               SIMULATION OF LOGIC GATES ,ADDERS AND SUBTRACTORS
                                               
AIM: To simulate Logic Gates ,Adders and Subtractors using Vivado 2023.2.

APPARATUS REQUIRED: VIVADO 2023.2

PROCEDURE: 
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. 

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. 

STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 

STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. 

STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 

STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. 

STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. 

STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA.

 VERILOG CODE
```
module logicgate (a,b,andgate,orgate,xorgate,nandgate,norgate,xnorgate,notgate);
input a,b;  
output andgate,orgate,xorgate,nandgate,norgate,xnorgate,notgate;
and(andgate,a,b);
or(orgate,a,b);
xor(xorgate,a,b);
nand(nandgate,a,b); 
nor(norgate,a,b);
xnor(xnorgate,a,b);
not(notgate,a);
endmodule
```

RESULT:
        Hence Logic Gates,Adders and Subtractor are simulated and synthesised using Xilinx ISE.
